# Salmon with Tequila Lime Sauce

## Ingredients

- [ ] 3 jalape√±os
- [ ] 3 tbsp olive oil
- [ ] 1 small onion, finely chopped
- [ ] 1 to 1 1/2 cup chicken stock
- [ ] grated rind and juice of two limes
- [ ] 1 cup heavy cream
- [ ] 2 tbsp reposada tequila
- [ ] 1 firm avocado
- [ ] 4 salmon fillets
- [ ] parsley or cilantro, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Roast the chiles in a frying pan until the skins are blistered, being careful not to let the flesh burn. Puth them in a strong plastic bag and tie the top to keep the steam in. Set aside for 20 minutes.
1. Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a saucepan. Add the onion and saute for 3-4 minutes, then add the stock, lime rind and juice. Cook for 10 minutes, until the stock starts to reduce. Remove the chiles from the bag and peel off the skins; slit and scrape out the seeds.
1. Stir the cream into the onion and stock mixture. Slice the chile flesh into strips and add to the pan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, for 2-3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and white pepper.
1. Stir the tequila into the onion and chilli mixture. Leave the pan over very low heat. Peel the avocado, remove the pit and slice the flesh. Brush the salmon fillets on one side with a little of the remaining oil.
1. Heat a frying pan or ridged pan until very hot and add the salmon, oiled side down. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the underside is golden, then brush the top with oil, turn each fillet over and cook the other side until the fish is cooked and flakes easily when tested with the tip of a sharp knife.
1. Serve on a pool of sauce, with the avocado slices. Garnish with strips of green peeper and parsley. This is good with fried potatoes.
